# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection - GUI Based Deep Learning Model

This project is a **Deep Learning-based system** for detecting diseases in plant leaves using a graphical user interface (GUI). The system takes an image of a leaf as input, processes it using a trained deep learning model, and predicts the disease affecting the leaf.

## 📌 Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: A simple interface for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for disease detection.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Provides disease classification instantly after image upload.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality before feeding into the model.
- **Scalability**: Can be trained on a variety of plant species.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Libraries Used**:
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
  - NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
  - Tkinter or PyQt (for GUI development)
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leaf-disease-detection.git
   Navigate to the project directory:
 2.navigate to project directory:
cd leaf-disease-detection
3.Install dependencies:
 
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Run the GUI application:
 
python gui.py

🏗️ Project Workflow
1.User uploads a leaf image through the GUI.
2.Image preprocessing improves the image quality.
3.Deep learning model predicts the disease.
4.The result is displayed in the GUI with a confidence score.
📊 Dataset
.The model is trained using a dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images.
.Data augmentation techniques are used to improve model performance.
🏆 Future Enhancements
.Implement a mobile app version for real-world usability.
.Extend the dataset for more plant species.
.Improve model accuracy using transfer learning.
